          I began in highschool when I started making websites just for fun. I
          continued this passion at
          <span className="text-highlight"> Cornell University </span>where I
          studied Information Science. Throughout my time, I first learned

          <span className="text-highlight-subtle">PHP</span> and{" "}
          <span className="text-highlight-subtle">SQL</span>. I learned not just
          how to program, but also about the value of the{" "}
          <span className="text-highlight-subtle"> user experience</span> we
          cultivate. I became fascinated with the thousands of small design
          choices that combine to deliver the seamless encounters we have with
          tech everyday. I took classes on{" "}
          <span className="text-highlight-subtle">
            Human Computer Interaction
          </span>{" "}
          and learned design principles as well as how to implement them. I also
          excelled in classes such{" "}

            Data Driven Web Development

          While studying, I was able to put the theory into practice when I

          built internal tools to help the team make investment insight.

          Now, I am a data analyst at{" "}
          <span className="text-highlight">Northwell Health</span>. I created
          programs to automate the daily tasks of the business teams using
          Python. One project I am most proud of is my automated scheduler.
          Instead of a business analyst taking hours to assign trainers to
          classes by week, my program does it by month in seconds, ensuring no
          trainer is assigned too many classes and there is variety in the
          classes they are assigned.
